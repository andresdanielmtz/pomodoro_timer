#  Personal Pomodoro Timer
 ## Powered by SwiftUI
 
 Designed mostly for iPadOS (with iOS support), this app is designed to help me as a lightweight alternative to many of the current apps. This project is mostly for educational and learning purposes and has no intentions of being pushed into the App Store. 
 
 To run this project you need `XCode` which is only available on macOS. 
 
 To-do list:
 - Add Break Timers (Priority)
 - Add Dark Mode support
